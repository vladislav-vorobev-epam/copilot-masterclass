## Code Generation
- Act as a senior java developer. I need a class diagram for a small Spring Boot REST API that enables scheduling test rides for Yamaha motorcycles. It should support SpringBoot. Implement Customer, Motorcycle and TestRide entities.
- Act as a senior java developer. Generate class files for the previous class diagram, using SpringBoot as a framework.
- Generate all necessary dependencies configuration in Gradle and update my existing build.gradle.kts
- Run gradle command to get and install all dependencies
- Convert my Main class into SpringBoot Application
- commit and push all changes to my repository

## Testing
- Act as a senior java developer. Write unit tests for the previous class files. Use spring-boot-test as test framework.
- Add tests for this class
